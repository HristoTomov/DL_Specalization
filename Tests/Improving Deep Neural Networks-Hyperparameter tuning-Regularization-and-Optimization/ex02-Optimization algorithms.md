# Optimization algorithms

### 1
Which notation would you use to denote the 3rd layer’s activations when the input is the 7th example from the 8th minibatch?

a[8]{7}(3)

a[3]{8}(7)
Correct

a[8]{3}(7)

a[3]{7}(8)

### 2
Which of these statements about mini-batch gradient descent do you agree with?

One iteration of mini-batch gradient descent (computing on a single mini-batch) is faster than one iteration of batch gradient descent.
Correct

You should implement mini-batch gradient descent without an explicit for-loop over different mini-batches, so that the algorithm processes all mini-batches at the same time (vectorization).

Training one epoch (one pass through the training set) using mini-batch gradient descent is faster than training one epoch using batch gradient descent.

### 3
Why is the best mini-batch size usually not 1 and not m, but instead something in-between?

If the mini-batch size is m, you end up with batch gradient descent, which has to process the whole training set before making progress.
Correct

If the mini-batch size is m, you end up with stochastic gradient descent, which is usually slower than mini-batch gradient descent.
Not selected is correct

If the mini-batch size is 1, you lose the benefits of vectorization across examples in the mini-batch.
Correct

If the mini-batch size is 1, you end up having to process the entire training set before making any progress.

### 4
uppose your learning algorithm’s cost J, plotted as a function of the number of iterations, looks like this:

Which of the following do you agree with?
If you’re using mini-batch gradient descent, this looks acceptable. But if you’re using batch gradient descent, something is wrong.
Correct

If you’re using mini-batch gradient descent, something is wrong. But if you’re using batch gradient descent, this looks acceptable.

Whether you’re using batch gradient descent or mini-batch gradient descent, this looks acceptable.

Whether you’re using batch gradient descent or mini-batch gradient descent, something is wrong.

Suppose the temperature in Casablanca over the first three days of January are the same:

Jan 1st: θ1=10oC
Jan 2nd: θ210oC
(We used Fahrenheit in lecture, so will use Celsius here in honor of the metric world.)

Say you use an exponentially weighted average with β=0.5 to track the temperature: v0=0, vt=βvt−1+(1−β)θt. If v2 is the value computed after day 2 without bias correction, and vcorrected2 is the value you compute with bias correction. What are these values? (You might be able to do this without a calculator, but you don't actually need one. Remember what is bias correction doing.)

v2=10, vcorrected2=10

v2=7.5, vcorrected2=7.5

v2=7.5, vcorrected2=10
Correct

v2=10, vcorrected2=7.5

###6

Which of these is NOT a good learning rate decay scheme? Here, t is the epoch number.

α=1t√α0

α=11+2∗tα0

α=etα0
Correct

α=0.95tα0

###7
You use an exponentially weighted average on the London temperature dataset. You use the following to track the temperature: vt=βvt−1+(1−β)θt. The red line below was computed using β=0.9. What would happen to your red curve as you vary β? (Check the two that apply)

Decreasing β will shift the red line slightly to the right.
Not selected is correct

Increasing β will shift the red line slightly to the right.
Correct
True, remember that the red line corresponds to β=0.9. In lecture we had a green line $$\beta = 0.98) that is slightly shifted to the right.

Decreasing β will create more oscillation within the red line.
Correct
True, remember that the red line corresponds to β=0.9. In lecture we had a yellow line $$\beta = 0.98 that had a lot of oscillations.

Increasing β will create more oscillations within the red line.
Not selected is correct

Suppose batch gradient descent in a deep network is taking excessively long to find a value of the parameters that achieves a small value for the cost function (W[1],b[1],...,W[L],b[L]). Which of the following techniques could help find parameter values that attain a small value for? (Check all that apply)

Try tuning the learning rate α
Correct

Try initializing all the weights to zero
Not selected is correct

Try better random initialization for the weights
Correct

Try mini-batch gradient descent
Correct

Try using Adam
Correct

### 10

Which of the following statements about Adam is False?

Adam should be used with batch gradient computations, not with mini-batches.
Correct

The learning rate hyperparameter α in Adam usually needs to be tuned.

Adam combines the advantages of RMSProp and momentum

We usually use “default” values for the hyperparameters β1,β2 and ε in Adam (β1=0.9, β2=0.999, ε=10−8)
